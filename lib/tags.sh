# Tags is sort of a database for images, messages, links, etc.
# You can set, delete and retrieve tags from the tags database.
# Tags database is simply a directory with the files named after
# the tag and its content will be the tag's content.
# To not let anyone delete someone's else tag, owner of the tag is
# stored in another directory. This is exactly the same as the tagdb
# but the content will the owner's name.
